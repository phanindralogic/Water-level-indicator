IC 8051: Detection of the water level and displaying the same on a LCD display. Coded in C using Keil µVision

Detection of the water level and displaying the same on a LCD display. Coded in C using Keil µVision We intend to measure and display the level of water in a container and avoid overflow of water. The idea can be implicitly used to ascertain and control the level of water in overhead tanks and prevent wastage.

We know that water conducts electricity when it’s slightly salinated (usually tap water contains certain salts). A wire from +Vcc is dipped in the water along with 4 other wires which represent the different levels of the tank viz. quarter, half, three-fourth and full. The IC used here is 8051 and a seven segmeny LCD display.
